I am building this single-page website from scratch using Underscores. I made sure the site was easily maintainable for the small business owner/chef by customizing the admin areas using custom fields, custom post types, Custom-Meta-Boxes (by Human Made Limited), and manipulating the WYSIWYG editor using TinyMCE Custom Styles. I am also using Bootstrap and installed Magnific Popup (by Dmitry Semenov) for the lightbox functionality in the gallery area.

I will say it again: THIS IS IN PRODUCTION! There are many tweeks to be made, but it's coming along!
